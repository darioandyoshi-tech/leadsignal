### License/Terms of Use: <br>


## Use Case: <br>
Developers and automation builders use this skill to let an agent operate a live desktop through mouse, keyboard, screen observation, clipboard, window management, and application-launch actions. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: The skill can control the live desktop, including keyboard, mouse, windows, screenshots, clipboard, and application launching. <br>
Mitigation: Install it only for intentional desktop-control use, start in an isolated or test session, and keep sensitive applications and secrets out of view. <br>
Risk: Automation actions may run with limited default confirmation. <br>
Mitigation: Keep failsafe enabled and prefer require_approval=True for workflows that type, click, use the clipboard, submit information, post publicly, or operate on files. <br>
Risk: Autonomous workflows can capture or save screenshots and interact with visible applications. <br>
Mitigation: Review each planned action before use in sensitive contexts and avoid autonomous operation when private data is visible. <br>
