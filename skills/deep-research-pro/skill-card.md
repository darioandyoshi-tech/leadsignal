## Use Case: <br>
Developers, researchers, and external users use this skill to plan multi-query web and news research, read selected sources, synthesize findings, and produce cited research reports. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Research queries and selected URLs may be sent to DuckDuckGo and third-party websites. <br>
Mitigation: Avoid sensitive research topics or instruct the agent not to use web access for sensitive work. <br>
Risk: Fetched third-party pages may contain inaccurate, outdated, or misleading information. <br>
Mitigation: Review cited sources, cross-check important claims, and treat single-source claims as unverified. <br>
Risk: The skill can save research reports locally. <br>
Mitigation: Ask the agent not to save files when local persistence is not desired. <br>
